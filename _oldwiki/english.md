# which vs that

The classrooms [that were painted over the summer] are bright and cheerful.
The classrooms, [which were painted over the summer], are bright and cheerful. 

We call the adjective clauses restrictive because they restrict--or limit--the meaning of the nouns they modify. In the case of the first sentence, they tell us that we are talking _only_ about the classrooms that were painted over the summer--not the others.

q: which vs that --- a: for restrictive clauses both are fine, for non-restrictive clauses, when you can remove them from the sentence without changing the meaning, use "which" with surrounding commas, e.g., "The classrooms that were painted over the summer are bright and cheerful." vs "The classrooms, which were painted over the summer, are bright and cheerful."
q: pronounciation: suite vs suit
