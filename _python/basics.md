# True, False, and comparisons

``` python
if () or [] or {} or None or 0 or '':
    'this line is skipped'
```

From <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing>:
> Considered false: instances with `__bool__()` returning False or `__len__()` returning zero. Built-ins:
> - `False`, `None`
> - zeroes of any numeric type: `0`, `0.0`, `Decimal(0)`, `Fraction(0, 1)`, `0j`
> - empty sequences and collections: `''`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `{}`, `set()`, `range(0)`

As in many languages, `and` and `or` are short-circuit operators, second argument is not evaluated here:
``` python
if False and whatever():
    'this line is skipped, whatever() is not evaluated'
```

Comparison operators look quite standard: `==`, `!=` (`<>` was removed from the language), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. And for object identity: `is`, `is not`.
> Behavior of the `is` and `is not` operators cannot be customized; also they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an exception.

Objects of different _built-in_ types never compare equal (except different numeric types), e.g., `'1' == 1` is false. `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` raise `TypeError` exception when the objects are of different types that cannot be compared.
``` python
>>> 'abc' > 1000
TypeError: unorderable types: str() > int()
```

`x < y < z` is equivalent to `x < y and y < z`, except `y` is evaluated only once. In both cases `z` is not evaluated at all when `x < y` is found to be false

Most importantly:

Use `if x`. Rarely `if x == True and type(x) is bool` when needed. Never `if x is True`, because `bool` is a subclass of `int`, this fails in obscure cases.

Same for `not x` and `False`.

An edge case is comparison to `None`. Use `if x is None`, never `x == None`. From [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations):
> Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not , never the equality operators. 

Good:
```
if x:
  ...
if not x:
  ...
if x == True and type(x) is bool:
  ...
if x == False and type(x) is bool:
  ...
if x is None:
  ...
```

Bad:

```
if x is True:
  ...
if x is False:
  ...
if x == True:
  ...
if x == False:
  ...
if x == None:
  ...
```

There is a thing in python, operator chaining. It's for things like `x < y < z`, which is roughly equivalent to `x < y and y < z`. \\
Except `y` is evaluated only once here. \\
Btw, in both cases `z` is not evaluated at all when `x < y` is false. \\
Be careful, with operator chaining, `1 == 1 in [1]` is unreadable and it's not obvios that it's an operator chaining.

- q: `type(s) is str` vs `type(s) == str` vs `isinstance(s, str)` -- a: Virtually no difference between `is` and `==` here, but people tend to use `is`. Type comparison answers the strict question: is this a type of object. `isinstance(o, cls)` considers type hierarcy.

<https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#apply>

## mutable (default) argument

This is a design flaw, explicitly documented here: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions>

> Default parameter values are evaluated from left to right when the function definition is executed.
> ...
> This is generally not what was intended.

The same effect can be easily achieved using let over lambda:

``` Python
def generate_f():
    default_mutable_argument = []
    def f(x, l = default_mutable_argument):
        l.append(x)
        return l
    return f

f = generate_f()
```

Python docs recommend this construct:

``` Python
def f(x, l = None):
    if l is None:
        l = []
    l.append(x)
    return l
```

Which can be enhanced slightly with type annotations for readability:

``` Python
def f(x, l: [] = None):
    ...
```

And doesn't mention this way at all:

``` Python
def f(a, L = []):
    L = copy(L)        # or deepcopy(L), or L[:], depending on context
    L.append(a)
    return L
```

Which is surprising to me. Because in this trivial example it makes sense, but here's another one:

``` Python
def f(a, L = None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return sum(L)/a
```

Here it really shouldn't modify the argument, but the mistake is obscure and can't be recognized.
TODO: a good real world example

In ruby it copies the default argument on every call and no puppy was harmed because of this.

## lambda

No return statement in lambdas: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda>

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/862412/is-it-possible-to-have-multiple-statements-in-a-python-lambda-expression>
just use a tuple: `lambda x: ( f(x), g(x) )`

# scope

Closures are good, for example, to have global scope clean, to replace hard-coded constants.

Python doesn't have open free variables: <http://effbot.org/zone/closure.htm>

```
def outer(msg):
    def inner():
        print(msg)
    return inner

i = outer('hell')
i()
# hell
```

```
def closure():
    count = 0
    def inner():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        print(count)
    return inner
i = clojure()
i()    # prints 1
i()    # prints 2
i()    # prints 3
```

If you don't declare a var `global`, a new local one is created:

```
x = 0

def f():
    x = 1
    print(x)

f()     # 1
x       # 0
```

Global actually means module scope.

Instance and class variables can only be accessed by explicitly providing the namespace:

``` Python
class Foo():
    x = 0
    def foo(self):
        self.__class__.x = 1
        self.x = 10

ff = Foo()
ff.x == 0
ff.foo()
ff.x == 10
Foo.x == 1
```

The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods -â€“ this includes comprehensions and generator expressions since they are implemented using a function scope:

``` Python
class Foo:
    x = 0
    def f(self):
        print(x)
        
Foo().f()     # NameError: name 'x' is not defined


class Foo:
    x = 0
    y = [x for _ in range(3)]     # NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

# conditionals and loops

# shallow and deep copy

<http://www.python-course.eu/deep_copy.php>

q: What are shallow copy and deep copy? --- When you do `a = [1, 2, 3]; b = a`, you bind both variables to a list object. Now, if you operate on `a` and modify it, you modify the object, so you'll see changes through the `b` variable. If the list is flat, you can create a shallow copy, so different vars are bound to different list objects. But if a list contains other lists, a shallow copy is not enough, you need to create a deep copy. The same can be said about other mutable containers like dicts and sets.
q: Get a deep copy of a list, dict, set, deque. --- a: `copy.deepcopy(thing)`
q: What does `l = lst[:]` mean? --- a: Creates a shallow copy of entire list.

# lists

lst.append(['c'])
lst.insert(0, '0')
lst == ['0', 'a', 'b', ['c']]

lst == [3, 1, 2]
sorted(lst)

`lst.sort()` returns `None`, here is why: <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-October/038855.html>

pre-allocating a list benchmark: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22225666/pre-allocating-a-list-of-none>

`lst.index(e)` raises `ValueError` when `e` is not in the list, because a value like `-1` could lead to obscure bugs
